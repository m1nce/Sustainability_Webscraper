Nike: Making strides towards net zero with sustainable foam | Sustainability MagazineFindAdvertiseEditorialArticleNet ZeroNike: Making strides towards net zero with sustainable foamBy Charlie KingJuly 17, 2023undefined minsNike's ReactX foam can be found in the new InfinityRN 4 road running trainers.
Credit | NikeReactX foam reduces the InfinityRN 4’s carbon footprint by 43%, supporting Nike’s journey to 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissionsFounded in 1964, American lifestyle brand Nike is a global household name with nearly 80,000 employees and US$50.6bn revenue in 2023.The company’s public facing brand stays fresh and stylish through a combination of partnerships and fresh perspective working in collaboration with classic, staple designs like Converse and Air Force.
Similarly, its attitudes to sustainability are held fast by core principles of reducing impact, whilst creating energetic partnerships with companies including technology partner Cognizant, Avangrid Renewables, Iberdrola and even Roblox and Snapchat.Sustainability targets: Working towards net zeroNike’s sustainability encompasses multiple areas of the business, including circular solutions which include supporting product care for longer life, promoting recycling of used products, selling refurbished return
The company is working towards its targets: 0.5m imperial tonnes less of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, through increasing use of environmentally preferred materials to 50% of all key materials: polyester, cotton, leather and rubber.
As of FY22, 182K+ metric tonnes of emissions were reduced by using 39% environmentally preferred materials in products.100% waste diverted from landfill in the extended supply chain with at least 80% of waste recycled back into Nike products and other goods by 2025.
Ninety-seven per cent waste diverted from landfill as of FY22.25% reduction of fresh water usage per kg in textile dyeing and finishing by 2025.70% reduction of GHG emissions in owned or operated facilities — 64% as of FY22.Material development powering Nike towards ESG goalsMore than 70% of any Nike product’s carbon footprint comes from materials, so it is unsurprising that the company is continuously developing sustainable materials.
Innovative material development includes:Nike Forward: An all-new material made from ultra-thin, needle-punched layers with a reduced carbon footprint of 75% on average when compared to traditional knit.Nike Flyknit: A lightweight fabric made from plastic bottles, precision-engineered with an average of 60% less waste than in traditional footwear upper manufacturing.
Nike Flyleather: Created by binding at least 50% recycled leather fibres with synthetic fibres using a water-powered process which is a low waste, low impact alternative to traditional leather.
Nike believes in developing sustainable materials that not only support the planet, but are also a better alternative for its customers.
"The company also imposes voluntary restrictions on chemicals, uses 100% organic, recycled or Better Cotton sourced through the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) as of 2020, and saves an average of one billion plastic bottles from landfills and waterways annually through using recycled polyester.ReactX: Reducing carbon footprint by 43%Nike’s newest development in sustainable material is a new ReactX foam cushioning unit, which is launching soon in the InfinityRN 4.
The ReactX Foam reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by over 43%, and offers improved support and cushioning for the user.
The foam is put through an injection process, rather than the compression moulding used previously, which boosts energy return whilst reducing carbon output.
Over the past five years, the material has been researched, developed and tested to ensure progress in both performance and environmental impact.“We are always looking for ways to improve our products' carbon footprint,” says Noel Kinder, Nike’s Chief Sustainability Officer, regarding the new material launch.

How ethical and sustainable is activewear brand Nike?
“The 47-page ‘greenwashing’ lawsuit charges broadly that Nike has illegally attempted to capitalise on consumers’ preference for ‘green’ products by falsely claiming that certain apparel tagged with ‘sustainable’ claims and marketed as supporting the retailer’s waste- and carbon-reducing ‘Move to Zero’ initiative are, unbeknownst to the public, made from non-biodegradable plastic-based materials,” reports ClassAction.org.
Though Nike has made a few positive changes to its environmental practices and is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, it still has a way to go before it can truly be called a more sustainable brand.
Nike uses some lower-impact materials, including organic and recycled cotton.
It uses some recycled leather in its leather products.
The Denmark-based brand puts sustainable thinking at the centre of everything—it only chooses fabrics that care for our environment, and only ever partners with factories that care about their impact.
The brand uses lower-impact materials like recycled polyester as well as lower-impact, non-toxic dyes and is fully OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified.
Made from a percentage of recycled Parley Ocean Plastic®, you can walk the walk knowing you helped prevent plastic waste from reaching the ocean.
It uses renewable energy in its supply chain to reduce its climate impact, and reuses all of its offcuts to minimise textile waste.

aim of reducing carbon emissions and creating long lasting products that have a minimal impact on the environment7May 2021TextSofia Mahirova First came the sneakers and swimwear crafted from recycled waste plastics.
Now, Nike is pushing the envelope once again with its 2021 sustainability goals in a bid to reduce its carbon emissions and create long lasting products that have minimal impact on the environment.
The pioneering sportswear brand has recently launched its 2021 Impact report, alongside a brand new Sustainability Microsite, which highlights its sustainability efforts and goals for the future.
With the focus on reducing its carbon footprint, Nike has set several targets based on scientific research, and building on the goals that the brand didn’t quite make in the year previous.
These include swapping the materials in its high-volume products with low-carbon alternatives; collaborating with independent factories and material suppliers to find better alternatives for production methods and energy sourcing; decreasing packaging and reducing its shipping emissions; and rolling out upcycling programmes like Nike Refurbished.
We’re launching our 2025 targets, which are super quantitative; the carbon targets are rooted in science.
That was a long time ago, but that that experimentation and innovation has led us to the point where we are now the biggest consumer of recycled polyester in our industry – which has a materially lower carbon footprint.
Virginia Rustique-Petteni: Among the targets that we've set for 2025 is to ‘10 X’ the amount of product waste we will be refurbishing, recycling, or reusing.
It quickly led them to conclude that they have to use recycled material, so waste was the feedstock for that.
Being able to understand that waste has a critical component, and reducing the carbon footprint.

Is Nike Sustainable?
By introducing the ‘Move to Zero’ initiatives and making sustainable materials commonplace in the collection, achieving full sustainability appears more achievable now than ever.
From switching SF6 gas in its Air Max to nitrogen to the recycled Space Hippie trainers, sustainability and innovation have been linked together to unlock success for Nike.
Nike’s realised it can’t wait for sustainable solutions — it must create them.
On top of this, Nike pledges to use only renewable energy sources and is exploring collaboration as a route to sustainability.
Most notably, they’ve become a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, which focuses on creating transformative change throughout the fashion industry.
Recycling Programmes <Credit: Nike> One of the biggest challenges between brands like Nike and achieving sustainability is the amount of waste they produce.
Currently, 92 million tonnes of textile waste end up in landfills every year, so how does Nike plan to reduce this number?
Recycling programmes are some of the most effective ways of reducing waste, as it involves the whole supply chain, including the end consumer.
This might explain why Nike has launched a recycling and donation programme to help them reach their sustainability targets.
It’s then sorted into batches for recycling or donation, with some products sent for recycling and others cleaned and donated.
Fewer waste materials and products in landfills, particularly when most sportswear products are made up of harmful fibres that don’t biodegrade, such as polyester.
By no means a new initiative, Nike Grind was started in 1992 to create a continuous loop without waste, repurposing old shoes that would otherwise head to landfills.
These recycled materials can be used for playgrounds, stoor flooring and displays, turf fields, courts, tracks and more, creating a sustainable sports future for the next generation.
Materials can make or break how sustainable a brand is, as they account for more than 70% of any product’s footprint.
Nike’s use of more sustainable materials increased from 41% to 59% in 2020.
Nike apparel labelled with ‘sustainable materials’ has at least 50% recycled content.
Nike significantly reduces its emissions and impact by reusing, recycling, and repurposing existing materials.
Nike Flyknit An ultra-flexible, lightweight fabric made from 60% less waste than traditional footwear, thanks to precision engineering.
Each Flyknit shoe upper contains up to seven recycled plastic bottles.
Nike Air All Nike Air soles are made from at least 50% recycled manufacturing waste and as of 2020, the Nike Air manufacturing facilities in North America are powered by 100% renewable wind energy.
Cushioning systems 90% of the waste materials for Air soles are repurposed into innovative cushioning systems.
Nike Forward An all-new material that's ultra-thin, soft, warm and lightweight, with a reduced carbon footprint of 75% on average.
Nike Flyleather Made from 50% recycled leather fibres and synthetic materials, this recycled leather has all the properties of virgin leather.
Leather has one of the highest carbon and waste footprints of any trainer material, which won’t help Nike’s carbon emissions targets.
Most significantly, in 2019, it announced its ‘Move to Zero’ mission — ‘Nike’s journey toward a zero carbon and zero waste future.’ It highlights Nike’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis with clear, timely targets to meet.
These include: Nike will power owned-and-operated facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2025.
Nike will reduce carbon emissions across its global supply chain by 30% by 2023, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Nike diverts 99% of all footwear manufacturing waste from landfills.
Nike diverts more than 1 billion plastic bottles annually from landfills to create yarns for new jerseys and uppers for Flyknit shoes.
